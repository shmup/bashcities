## Workflow example

Below is my current workflow. Basically I do some some stuff, commit it, then push with bashcities.

You can get your api key from https://neocities.org/settings ðŸ ’  manage site settings ðŸ ’  api key.

```
    bashcities init ezpz          # (creates ~/.config/neocities/ezpz)
    vim ~/.config/neocities/ezpz  # (edit the api_key and site_directory)
    cd ~/site_directory
    echo wazzup > index.html
    git init; git add index.html; git commit -m "Show how this thing works"
    bashcities -p ezpz push
```
